go-server-starter
=================

Go port of [Server::Starter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Server::Starter) (NOT DONE YET)

## For The Brave Of Hearts

I repeat: This is NOT DONE YET.

But even knowing that this software is still buggy and you want to try it out, just do:

```
$ go get ./...
$ go build cmd/start_server/start_server.go
$ ./start_server --port=5000 -- your_server
```
